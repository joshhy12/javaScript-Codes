document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";

External JavaScript Advantages
Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

It separates HTML and code
It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

External References
An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:

With a full URL (a full web address)
With a file path (like /js/)
Without any path
This example uses a full URL to link to myScript.js:

<script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script>















<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
}
</script>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Demo JavaScript in Head</h2>

<p id="demo">A Paragraph.</p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

</body>
